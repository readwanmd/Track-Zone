## Overview

Let's say you have three overseas clients. They are located in different countries. You meet with such clients on a daily basis, however, the time of the appointments is flexible. The meeting time will be communicated to you by the clients once they have set one. They will, however, provide you with the meeting time in their local time zone, which is a problem. As an example, the Australian client scheduled a meeting for 5:00 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time. How will recall every meeting time when we are in separate time zones?

This application has the capacity to save meeting times according to particular time zones. It features multiple time zones, including EST, PST, and UTC. A user can set up a clock for a certain time zone and add meetings to it. The time of each meeting will be displayed in the designated clock time zone. Additionally, the time difference between the user's local time zone and the specified time zone is displayed.
